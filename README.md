Solver based on a Memetic Algorithm with explicit management of diversity for the one-sided crossing minimization problem.

In order to compile it, just enter the src folder and execute make. The only dependency is g++.

In order to execute it, no parameters are required. The seed for the random number generator is taken from the time where the program is executed. The input instance is read from stdin, and the result is written to stdout.
